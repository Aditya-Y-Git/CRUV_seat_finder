# Seat Finder App

The Seat Finder App is a Flutter application that helps users find and highlight specific seats in a train coach. It provides a search functionality where users can enter a seat number, and the app will scroll to that seat on the screen.

## Methodologies Used

The Seat Finder App is developed using the Flutter framework, which allows for cross-platform app development using a single codebase. Here are some of the methodologies used in this project:

- Flutter SDK: The app is built using Flutter, which provides a rich set of widgets and tools for building beautiful and performant user interfaces.

- State Management: The app utilizes the built-in state management capabilities of Flutter to handle dynamic data and UI updates efficiently.

- Scroll Controller: The `ScrollController` class from the Flutter framework is used to control the scrolling behavior of the `GridView` widget and navigate to the desired seat.
